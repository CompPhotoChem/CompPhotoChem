## üåü About Us

At the intersection of light and matter, we explore how molecules behave when excited by photons.  
Our research aims to unravel fundamental mechanisms in:

- Photoinduced Electron and energy transfer processes
- Photoisomerization  
- Photochemical reaction dynamics

By leveraging methods of *theoretical chemistry* (e.g., electronic structure theory, nonadiabatic dynamics) and *digital chemistry* (e.g., machine learning, data-driven modeling, cheminformatics), 
we decode complex photochemical behavior with atomistic detail.

## üéØ Our Mission

Our mission is to advance understanding and control of photoinduced processes by:

- Developing and applying advanced computational models  
- Integrating digital and data-centric methods in chemical research  
- Supporting experimental photochemistry through predictive simulations  
- Enabling rational design of light-driven systems with improved efficiency and sustainability
